#LINUX CMD INSTRUCTIONS TO SETUP A NEW RASPBERRY PI TO BE USED AS A PART COUNTER



#Note to LISI: The packages are for the IP address prototype script. For running MQTT with Python, install paho-mqtt 

#Install necessary packages with:
sudo apt install python3-icmplib

#To run a script on startup, run it as a kernel service:

touch /etc/systemd/system/ip_autoping.service #creates empty file, navigate there with:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ip_autoping.service

#Enter details of the service:

---
[Unit]

#Now run it with:
sudo systemctl start ip_autoping #Runs the networktest script now
sudo systemctl enable ip_autoping #Sets the networktest script to run every boot
sudo systemctl status ip_autoping #to check if it has worked

#To conigure the raspberry pi to the LISI network without a GUI, create a wpa_supplicant file:

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

#Inside the conf file:
---
network={
    ssid="MANUFACTURING"
    psk="5Lp*RZo8fzr@NbU"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
---
iwconfig #to check upon reboot if the wireless connection was successful
