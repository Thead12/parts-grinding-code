🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

Recommended: Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Thead12/parts-grinding-code.git
cd parts-grinding-code
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

Note: Create a requirements.txt file listing all dependencies for easier installation.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the file directories:

Refer to kernel_setup.txt for detailed instructions on setting up the necessary file directories. Proper configuration is essential for the scripts to function correctly.

🧪 Usage
Collecting Data and Training the Model
Use collect_and_train.py to collect data and train your machine learning model.

bash
Copy
Edit
python collect_and_train.py
Ensure that your data is organized as specified in kernel_setup.txt before running this script.

Real-Time Classification
Run real_time_classifier.py to perform real-time classification of grinding parts.

bash
Copy
Edit
python real_time_classifier.py
Real-Time Visualization
Use real_time_graphs.py to visualize data in real-time.

bash
Copy
Edit
python real_time_graphs.py
🛠️ Configuration
The project utilizes CircularBuffer.py to manage data streams efficiently. Ensure that all configurations are set as per the guidelines in kernel_setup.txt.

Python library for managing long running tasks, we can use this to initialise and close the program automatically I believe.

UPDATE AT THE END TO BE A PROFESSIONAL README, NEEDS USAGE INSTRUCTIONS AS THE TECH DOC REFERS THE USER HERE
Need to include instructions for setting up the file directories as I have them in the kernel_setup.txt file else the configs will break
